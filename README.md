# Personal Information Web Page

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to design a simple, visually appealing web page that displays personal information. The page was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Implementation Details

HTML Structure
 - The page uses a main <div> container with a heading and an information section.
 - The id="info" element serves as the target container for displaying personal data.

CSS Styling
 - The body element includes:
 - A full-screen background image.
 - A semi-transparent dark overlay to improve readability of the text.
 - The container is centered on the screen, with:
 - A white background and slight opacity.
 - Rounded corners and shadow effects for a modern look.
 - Text styling uses readable fonts and subtle colors to improve user experience.

JavaScript Logic
 - A JavaScript object stores the user’s information:
 - Name, Age, Gender, Female, Country, Education
